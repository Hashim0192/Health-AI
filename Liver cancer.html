Liver Cancer 
</h1>
<p>
Liver cancer is a cancer that's found anywhere in the liver.
The liver is a large organ at the top right side of your tummy.
It helps you digest your food and removes toxins.
Liver cancer can sometimes start in your liver (primary) or spread from another organ (secondary).
How serious liver cancer is depends on where it is in the liver, how big it is, if it has spread, if it's primary or secondary and your general health.
</p>
<h2>
Causes
</h2>
<p>
Who is more likely to get liver cancer
Anyone can get primary liver cancer. It's not always clear what causes it.

You might be more likely to get it if you:

are over the age of 60, it's most common in people over 85
are a man
have certain medical conditions, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, gallstones, diabetes, a parasite in the liver (liver flukes), and HIV
have a brother, sister or parent who had primary liver cancer
Secondary liver cancer is caused by cancer cells from a cancer somewhere else in the body spreading to the liver.

Many liver cancers are also linked to your lifestyle.

<h2>
Symptoms
</h2>
<p>
Main symptoms of liver cancer
Liver cancer may not have any symptoms, or they might be hard to spot.

Symptoms of liver cancer can include:

your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow (jaundice), you may also have itchy skin, darker pee and paler poo than usual
loss of appetite or losing weight without trying to
feeling tired or having no energy
feeling generally unwell or having symptoms like flu
a lump in the right side of your tummy

feeling or being sick
pain at the top right side of your tummy or in your right shoulder
symptoms of indigestion, such as feeling full very quickly when eating
a very swollen tummy that is not related to when you eat

<h2>
Treatments
</h2>
<p>
Treatment for liver cancer
Liver cancer is often treatable, but it can be difficult to treat.

The treatment you have will depend on:

if the cancer started in the liver (primary) or spread from somewhere else (secondary), but treatments for primary and secondary liver cancer are similar
the size and type of liver cancer you have
where it is
if it has spread
your general health
It may include surgery, chemotherapy, using heat to destroy the cancer (thermal ablation), using targeted medicines, and radiotherapy.

The specialist care team looking after you will:

explain the treatments, benefits and side effects
work with you to create a treatment plan that is best for you
help you manage any side effects, including changes to your diet to help you digest your food
You'll have regular check-ups during and after any treatments. You may also have tests and scans.

If you have any symptoms or side effects that you are worried about, talk to your specialists. You do not need to wait for your next check-up.
</p>
<p> 
Surgery:

If liver cancer is found early, is small and it has not spread, you may be able to have surgery to remove it.

Surgery will remove part or all of your liver. If it is all removed you will need a liver transplant to replace your liver with a donated one.

Recovery from surgery to treat liver cancer can take a long time. The specialist team looking after you will discuss all the benefits and side effects.
