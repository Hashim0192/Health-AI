Treatment for lung cancer is managed by a team of specialists from different departments who work together to provide the best possible treatment.

This team includes the health professionals required to make a diagnosis, to stage your cancer and to plan the best treatment. If you want to know more, ask your doctor or nurse about this.

The type of treatment you receive for lung cancer depends on several factors, including:

the type of lung cancer you have (non-small-cell or small-cell mutations on the cancer)
the size and position of the cancer
how advanced your cancer is (the stage)
your overall health
Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.

The most common treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Depending on the type of cancer and the stage, you may receive a combination of these treatments.
