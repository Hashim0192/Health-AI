Diabetes
</h1>
<p>
Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high. There are 2 types diabetes
</p>
<p> Type 1 diabetes is caused by where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin.
Type 2 diabets is where the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells do not react to insulin. 
</p>
<p>
Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2.
</p>
<p>
Here are more points about diabetes : 
</p>
<h2>
Causes
</h2>
<p>
The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).

When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy.

However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced does not work properly.

There are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes.

You can help manage type 2 diabetes through healthy eating, regular exercise and achieving a healthy body weight.
</p>
<h2>
Symptoms
</h2>
<p>
The main symptoms of diabetes type 1 and 2 are:

Increased thirst.
Frequent urination.
Extreme hunger.
Unexplained weight loss.
Presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin)
Fatigue.
Irritability.
</p>
<h2> 
Treatments
</h2>
<p>
Theres no current cure for diabetes type 1 and 2. However, its recommended that if you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll need to eat healthily, take regular exercise and carry out regular blood tests to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced.

You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to check whether you're a healthy weight.

People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes also require regular insulin injections for the rest of their life.

As type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, medicine may eventually be required, usually in the form of tablets.
