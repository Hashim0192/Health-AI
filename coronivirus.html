Coronavirus is relatively new but has been heavily researched over the last three few years. It has been so heavily researched as it was a deadly illness that was spreading. It has now caused
an pandemic spanning for around 3 years. This has been a global problem since around 2020 and has many people worried on different views on everything and how they should react. There are

<h2>
Treatments
</h2>

<p>
Though a international treatment has not yet been agreed upon there are many different vaccines that are available such as the <b>Moderna Vaccine</b>, the <b>phizer Vaccine</b> and many more
though throughout England these are more commonly used. These are not always agreed upon by "anti-vaxxer" but I'll warn that even if you do not agree with what is being said by this website
you should at least wear a mask in order to keep yourself safe or at least others safe. There are also other treatments in other countries if wanted but others like the chinese version
has had it's creator take the phizer vaccine showing it is not as safe as can be said.
