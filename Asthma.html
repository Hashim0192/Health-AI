<h2>
Treatments
</h2>
<p>
There's currently no cure for asthma, but treatment can help control the symptoms so you're able to live a normal, active life.

Inhalers, which are devices that let you breathe in medicine, are the main treatment. Tablets and other treatments may also be needed if your asthma is severe.

You'll usually create a personal action plan with a doctor or asthma nurse.

This includes information about your medicines, how to monitor your condition and what to do if you have an asthma attack.

<p>
Inhaler:

Relieve symptoms when they occur (reliever inhalers)
stop symptoms developing (preventer inhalers)
Some people need an inhaler that does both (combination inhalers).
